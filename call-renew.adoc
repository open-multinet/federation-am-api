[[Renew]]
=== Renew

Request that the named slivers be renewed, with their expiration extended. If possible, the aggregate should extend the slivers to the requested expiration time, or to a sooner time if policy limits apply. This method applies to slivers that are +:allocated+ or to slivers that are +:provisioned+, though different policies may apply to slivers in the different states, resulting in much shorter max expiration times for +:allocated+ slivers.

.Call Syntax
[source]
----------------
Renew(string urns[],
      struct credentials[],
      dateTime.rfc3339 :end_time, 
      struct options)
----------------

When +Renew+ is called with +:best_effort+ false, the entire method will fail (return non-zero +:code+) if any requested sliver cannot be renewed to the requested time, and all slivers will keep their original expiration time. When +Renew+ is called with +:best_effort+ true, some slivers may fail to be renewed. In this case, the allocation state and expiration times do not change. +:error+ may optionally be returned by the aggregate to explain this failure.

As described in the <<OperationsOnIndividualSlivers, Operations On Individual Slivers>> section, the +:single_allocation+ return from <<GetVersion>> advertises whether or not a client may invoke this method on only some of the slivers in a given +:allocation_state+ in a given slice (default is false - the client may operate on only some of the slivers in a given state).

+Renew+ requests a changed expiration for one or more slivers in a slice. At some aggregates, this expiration may be shorter. This method applies both to slivers that are +:allocated+ and to those that are already +:provisioned+. Depending on local aggregate configuration, the aggregate may only support +Renew+ on all current slivers in the slice, or may permit renewing only some slivers. Local policy will dictate maximum expiration times. These times are typically quite short (\~ 10 minutes initially, \~ 120 minutes maximum) for reservations (+:allocated+), and longer for provisioned (+:provisioned+) slivers (~ 5-8 days initially). Since these expiration times are different, typically +Renew+ is used only for slivers in the same allocation state. 

==== Argument 1:  +urns+

See the <<CommonArgumentUrns, +urns+ argument>> for details.

==== Argument 2:  +credentials+

The standard authorization argument. See <<CommonArgumentCredentials, the Credentials section>>.

==== Argument 3: +:end_time+

See <<CommonOptionEndTime, +:end_time+ option>> for details. Note that here, it is a mandatory argument.

////////////////////////
The date-time string in  RFC 3339 format in UTC when the reservation(s) should be extended until.
////////////////////////

==== Argument 4:  +options+

A struct containing optional arguments, indexed by name. See <<OptionsArgument,General Options Argument Section>>.

==== Option: +:best_effort+

See <<CommonOptionBestEffort, +:best_effort+ option>> for details.

Specifying whether the client prefers all included slivers to be renewed or none, or wants a partial success if possible.

==== Return Value

***********************************
[horizontal]
XML-RPC type:: +struct+
***********************************

See the <<CommonReturnSliverInfoList, sliver info list return>> for details.
 
On success, the value field of the return struct will contain a list of structs:

***********************************
[horizontal]
XML-RPC type::
[source]
[
  {
   ":sliver_urn": <string>,
   ":allocation_status": <string>,
   ":operational_status": <string>,
   ":expires": <string: dateTime.rfc3339 when the sliver expires from its current state>,
   (optional) ":error": <string: explaining any renewal failure for this sliver. The field may be omitted entirely but may not be null/None>
  },
  ...
]
***********************************

///////////////////////////////////////////////////
Old version:
Calling +Renew+ on an unknown, deleted or expired sliver (by explicit URN) shall result in an error (e.g. SEARCHFAILED, EXPIRED or ERROR +:code+) (unless +:best_effort+ is true, in which case the method may succeed, but return a +:error+ for each sliver that failed). Attempting to +Renew+ a slice (no slivers identified) with no current slivers at this aggregate may return an empty list of slivers, may return a list of previous slivers that have since been deleted, or may even return an error (SEARCHFAILED or EXPIRED). Note therefore that an empty list is a valid return from this method.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////

Expired, deleted and unknown slivers, or slices without valid slivers, will cause this call to return SEARCHFAILED. See <<CommonArgumentUrns, the +urns+ argument>> for more details on this error code and return value.

It is legal to attempt to renew a sliver to a sooner expiration time than the sliver was previously due to expire. Not all aggregates will support this however.

==== Return Codes and Errors

The +Renew+ call can return the usual error codes: BADARGS, ERROR, SERVERERROR and UNAVAILABLE. See <<ErrorCodes,Error Codes>> for general errors.

Additionally, the +Renew+ call can return the following error codes:
[horizontal]
FORBIDDEN:: Credential does not grant permission to a slice or sliver specified in the +urns+ argument. Or the slice has been shut down.
UNSUPPORTED:: The aggregate does not permit partial renewals of this form.
EXPIRED:: The slice and/or sliver has already expired.
SEARCHFAILED:: The slice or sliver does not exist at this AM.
BUSY:: Slice or sliver is temporarily locked, try again later
