[[Status]]
=== Status

Get the status of a sliver or slivers belonging to a single slice at the given aggregate. +Status+ may include other dynamic reservation or instantiation information as required by the resource type and aggregate. This method is used to provide updates on the state of the resources after the completion of <<Provision>>, which began to asynchronously provision the resources. This should be relatively dynamic data, not descriptive data as returned in the manifest RSpec.

In contrast to <<Describe>>, +Status+ is used to query dynamic state information about slivers. Aggregates may include detailed configuration information at their own discretion.

.Call Syntax
[source]
----------------
Status(string urns[], struct credentials[], struct options)
----------------

NOTE: This operation used to be called +SliverStatus+ in earlier versions of the AM API. :slivers has replaced :resources and :sliver_urn replaces :urn. :status is replaced with 2 fields, :allocation_status and :operational_status.

==== Argument 1:  +urns+

See the <<CommonArgumentUrns, +urns+ argument>> for details.

==== Argument 2:  +credentials+

The standard authorization argument. See <<CommonArgumentCredentials, the Credentials section>>.

==== Argument 3:  +options+

A struct containing optional arguments, indexed by name. See <<OptionsArgument,General Options Argument Section>>.

This method has no options that are required to be supported by AM's.

NOTE: *TODO the original AMv3 text speaks about +geni_best_effort+ in the return value description of the +Status+ call. This is inconsistent with the sentence above.*

==== Return Value

***********************************
[horizontal]
XML-RPC type:: +struct+
***********************************

See the <<CommonReturnSliverInfoList, sliver info list return>> for details.

On success, the value field of the return struct will contain a struct:

***********************************
[horizontal]
XML-RPC type::
[source]
{
  ":urn": <string: slice URN>
  ":slivers": [ 
                 {
                   ":sliver_urn": <string: sliver URN>
                   ":allocation_status": <string: eg provisioned>
                   ":operational_status": <string: eg ready>
                   ":expires": <string: dateTime.rfc3339 of individual sliver expiration>
                   ":error": <string: eg '' - not null/None and not optional>,
                 },
                 ...
              ]
}
***********************************

Note that aggregates may return other information, such as details on sliver contents, etc.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////
Old version:
Calling +Status+ on an unknown, deleted or expired sliver (by explicit URN) shall result in an error (e.g. SEARCHFAILED, EXPIRED or ERROR) (unless +:best_effort+ is true, in which case the method may succeed, but return a +:error+ for each sliver that failed). Attempting to get +Status+ for a slice (no slivers identified) with no current slivers at this aggregate may return an empty list for +:slivers+, may return a list of previous slivers that have since been deleted, or may even return an error (e.g. SEARCHFAILED or EXPIRED). Note therefore that +:slivers+ may be an empty list.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////

Expired, deleted and unknown slivers, or slices without valid slivers, will cause this call to return SEARCHFAILED. See <<CommonArgumentUrns, the +urns+ argument>> for more details on this error code and return value.

==== Return Codes and Errors

The +Status+ call can return the usual error codes: BADARGS, ERROR, SERVERERROR and UNAVAILABLE. See <<ErrorCodes,Error Codes>> for general errors.

Additionally, the +Status+ call can return the following error codes:
[horizontal]
FORBIDDEN:: Credential does not grant permission to a slice or sliver specified in the +urns+ argument. Or the slice has been shut down.
UNSUPPORTED:: The aggregate does not permit operations on individual slivers in the same slice of this form. *TODO what does this exactly mean? Is this so?* 
EXPIRED:: The slice and/or sliver has expired.
SEARCHFAILED:: The slice or sliver does not exist at this AM.
BUSY:: Slice or sliver is temporarily locked, try again later
